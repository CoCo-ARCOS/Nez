**"Nez: A design-driven skeleton model to build AI-based and analytic systems deployed on the computing continuum"**

---

## üìñ Overview

**Nez** is a design-driven skeleton model that enables the construction of AI-based and analytic systems that run seamlessly across the **computing continuum** (from edge to cloud to HPC).

### Key Features
- Automatic integration of AI applications with **security, fault-tolerance, and data management tools**.  
- A **self-similar construction model** based on generic and portable structures.  
- Simplified development of secure, efficient, and resilient AI pipelines.

## üè• Case Study

Nez was evaluated in a real-world healthcare scenario at a Mexican hospital, where it was used to build systems for:
- **3D mesh tomography representation**  
- **Lung cancer diagnosis**  
- **ECG analysis reports**  

All systems were deployed for **continuous, secure delivery** of digital products to physicians.
