# Overview

Organizations increasingly rely on **AI and ML** to process data, automate tasks, and support decision-making.  
The **computing continuum** (edge–fog–cloud) enables these applications to run closer to data sources, reducing latency and improving efficiency.  

## ❌ The Challenge
- Manual deployment and integration are complex.  
- Non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as **security**, **fault tolerance**, and **reliability** are difficult to enforce.  
- Heterogeneous infrastructures increase complexity.

## ✅ The Solution
**Nez** introduces a **skeleton model**:
- Automatically couples **AI applications** with **NFR components**.  
- Provides a **design-driven interface** for system creation.  
- Dynamically deploys across multiple infrastructures.  

Nez has been validated in **medical imaging** and **satellite imagery** case studies, outperforming workflow engines such as **Nextflow, Parsl, and Makeflow**.
